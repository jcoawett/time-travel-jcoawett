#### .gitignore patterns
'*.log' and '*.tmp' : Excluds temporary and log files that should not be added to therepo. 'target' and 'build/' exclude the compiled output files. '.DS_Store' and'Thumbs.db' Exclde the OS generated files. The rest are IDE files that do not need to be pushed as those are local settings that should be kept personal
