## What I Learned
I learned how to effectively use feature branches for parallel development, manage merge conflicts through pull requests, and use tags for version management. The branch workflow (author/idea-sprint and editor/review) helped me understand real-world collaboration patterns.

## Mistakes I Fixed
1. Initially forgot to reference issue numbers in commit messages, had to amend commits to include "Closes #X" syntax
2. Pushed directly to main instead of creating a feature branch, had to revert and create proper PR workflow

## Command That Saved the Day
The command `git log --graph --oneline --all` was invaluable for visualizing the entire branch structure and understanding how all my branches, merges, and conflicts related to each other. It made the complex merge conflict resolution much clearer.
